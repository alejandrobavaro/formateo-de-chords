Queen - Say It's Not True (Guitar Chords)

B 
The harder we play 
              G#m 
The faster we fall 
                              C#m 
When we think that we know it all 
                   F# 
We know nothing at all 
 
           B 
The letter arrives 
                    G#m       
Like a bolt for the blue 
                       C#m 
So what's left of your lives 
                        F# 
All your dreams lost to you 
 
             E 
Say it's not true 
         B 
Say it today 
               G#m 
When I open my eyes 
               F# 
Will it all go away 
 
             E 
Say it's not true 
             B    G#m 
Say it's not real 
                      C#m   E 
Can't be happening to you 
                      B 
Can't be happening to me 
 
It's hard not to cry 
It's hard to believe 
So much heartache and pain 
So much reason to grieve 
 
With the wonders of science 
All the knowledge we've stored 
Magic cocktails for lives 
People just can't afford 
 
Say it's not true 
You can say it's not right 
It's hard to believe 
The size of the crime 
 
Say it's not true 
You can say it's not real 
Could be happening to you 
Could be happening to me
