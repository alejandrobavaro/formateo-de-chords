Queen - keep yourself alive (Guitar Chords)
(Brian May)


verse 1 

      F 
I was told a million times 
           A#             F 
Of all the troubles in my way 
How to grow a little wiser,   
       A#          F 
Little better evry day 
         C 
But if I crossed a million rivers 
      C# 
And I rode a million miles 
        G# 
Then Id still be where I started 
          C 
Bread and butter for a smile 
       F 
Well I sold a million mirrors 
     A#             F 
In a shoppin' alley way 
But I never saw my face 
       A#         F 
In any window any day 
          C 
Well they say your folks are telling you 
   C# 
To be a super star 
      G# 
But I tell you just be satisfied 
   A7 
To stay right where you are 

Chorus -----------------
D             G 
Keep yourself alive  
D             A 
keep yourself alive 
      D                 D 
It'll take you all your time and a money 
D     A        D 
Honey youll survive 
End Chorus -------------


verse 2 

         F       
Well Ive loved a million women 
     A#         F 
In a belladonic haze 
And I ate a million dinners 
           A#           F 
Brought to me on silver trays 
        C 
Give me evrything I need 
           C# 
To feed my body and my soul 
        G# 
And Ill grow a little bigger 
      C 
Maybe that can be my goal 
      F 
I was told a million times 
           A#           F 
Of all the people in my way 
How I had to keep on trying 
        A#          F 
And get better evry day 
         C 
But if I crossed a million rivers 
      C# 
And I rode a million miles 
        G# 
Then Id still be where I started 
A7 
Still be where I started 

Chorus -----------------
D             G     D             A 
Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive 
     D                 G              D 
Itll take you all your time and money honey 
A     D 
Youll survive 
D             G      D              A 
Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive 
      D                 G 
It'll take you all your time and money 
   D       A    D 
To keep me satisfied
End Chorus -------------
