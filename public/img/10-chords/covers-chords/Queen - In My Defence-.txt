Queen - In My Defence (Guitar Chords)

   G                  Em    
In my defence what is there to say
           C                     D  
All the mistakes we made must be faced today
          G               Em   
It's not easy now knowing where to start
           C                     D
While the world we love tears itself apart


Chorus:
            G     G/F#    Em
I'm just a singer with a song
          C                 D 
How can I try to right the wrong
            G     G/F#   Em 
For just a singer with a melody
               C                     D
I'm caught in between with a fading dream



In my defence what is there to say

We destroy the love it's our way

We never listen enough never face the truth

Then like a passing song love is here and then is gone



Chorus: ... 
(I am not very sure about following chords)
          C                      D 
Caught in between with a fading dream
          C                     G 
Caught in between with a fading dream
Em               C     
Oh what on Earth oh what on Earth
Em       C   D             G        
How do I try do we live or die
   C                  G  
Oh help me God please help me
 



  G            Em           C            D            G/F#
